# Unofficial SRG SSR Replay

## Migration
This add-on has been migrated from [SRF Podcast Plugin](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:SRF_Podcast_Plugin) [[source code](https://github.com/ambermoon/xbmc_plugin_video_srf_podcast_ch)] as its development seems to be on hold and unfortunately the add-on is not compatible with the newest Kodi version anymore. Thanks to all the previous developers who maintained the original add-on that I used and appreciated a lot.

Later this add-on has been re-branded from the [Unofficial SRF Replay](https://kodi.tv/addons/matrix/plugin.video.srf_ch_replay) [[source code](https://github.com/ManBehindMooN/kodi_plugin_video_srf_ch_replay)] in order to support more features.

## Add-on description
The add-on has been renamed to "Unofficial SRG SSR Replay". It supports all the official channels (SRF, SRF Info, RTS, RSI und RSR) and can list and stream these TV shows.

All other usage information can be found on the [README on github](https://github.com/ManBehindMooN/kodi_plugin_video_srgssr_ch_replay)
